You can find my recent projects for IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate

## bigmart-sales-data-eda.ipynb is the final project for the course "Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning"

I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing on the sales data.

## seoul-bike-data-regression.ipynb is the final project for the course "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression"

Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built linear, polynomial, Ridge and random forest regression models and compared model performances with K-fold cross validation for the bike sharing data. I used GridSearch to tune the hyperparameters for Ridge regression.

## obesity-data-classification.ipynb is the final project for the course "Supervised Machine Learning: Classification"

Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and Adaboost classification models and compared model performances with using stratified-shuffle-split and GridSearch cross validation. I also showed the feature importances with the proposed final model.
