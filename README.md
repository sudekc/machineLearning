You can find my recent projects for the courses in [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning?=) here.

## Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning

[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the BigMart Sales Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/ac953ba66476219740b328b793d8f38651e5836a/bigmart-sales-data-eda.ipynb) I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing on the sales data.

## Supervised Machine Learning: Regression

[Regression Models for the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/035a398c1449e706c44a1fca0c0a8bf76a6c9d33/seoul-bike-data-regression.ipynb) Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built linear, polynomial, Ridge, and random forest regression models and compared model performances with K-fold cross-validation for the bike-sharing data. I used GridSearch to tune the hyperparameters for Ridge regression.

## Supervised Machine Learning: Classification

[Classification Models for the Obesity Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/035a398c1449e706c44a1fca0c0a8bf76a6c9d33/obesity-data-classification.ipynb) Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and Adaboost classification models and compared model performances using stratified-shuffle-split and GridSearch cross-validation. I also showed the feature importances with the proposed final model.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning
[Clustering Models for the Travel Review Ratings Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/27ac027a19b7d2275adb1673ca7bf53fd402b8e1/travel-review-clustering.ipynb) I used PCA for dimensionality reduction. I built K-means, agglomerative ward, and spectral clustering models to cluster unlabeled data. I assumed the number of clusters is known (with the help of K-means), and I compared the models by evaluating their Calinski-Harabasz indexes to come up with a recommendation. 

## Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
[Deep Learning Models for the Wine Quality Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/be917f925efc5ba446ed25d99d7aaf242287cc65/wine-quality-deep-learning.ipynb) I built basic neural networks with Keras for regression and classification. I compared the deep learning models with sklearn's default random forest regressor and classifier.

I always share the resources for the datasets I use, I do not prefer to upload them to this repository as I do not know their consent rights.

Please share your comments and suggestions with me, I am new around! Thank you.
