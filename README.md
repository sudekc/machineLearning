You can find my recent projects for the courses in [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning?=) here.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/PD3LRSU43QLY)

[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the BigMart Sales Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/ac953ba66476219740b328b793d8f38651e5836a/bigmart-sales-data-eda.ipynb) I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and hypothesis testing on the sales data.

## [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/EKSL4HAT7MRN)

[Regression Models for the Seoul Bike Sharing Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/035a398c1449e706c44a1fca0c0a8bf76a6c9d33/seoul-bike-data-regression.ipynb) Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built linear, polynomial, Ridge and random forest regression models and compared model performances with K-fold cross validation for the bike sharing data. I used GridSearch to tune the hyperparameters for Ridge regression.

## [Supervised Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/EVGTLZXLW5N2)

[Classification Models for the Obesity Dataset: ](https://github.com/sudekc/machineLearning/blob/035a398c1449e706c44a1fca0c0a8bf76a6c9d33/obesity-data-classification.ipynb) Alongside EDA and feature engineering, I built logistic regression, decision tree, random forest and Adaboost classification models and compared model performances with using stratified-shuffle-split and GridSearch cross validation. I also showed the feature importances with the proposed final model.
